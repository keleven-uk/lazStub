<H3 style=3D"TEXT-ALIGN: center">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</H3>
<P style=3D"TEXT-ALIGN: center">Version 3, 29 June 2007</P>
<P>Copyright =C2=A9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<A=20
href=3D"http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</A>&gt;</P>
<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this =
license=20
document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<H3><A name=3Dpreamble></A>Preamble</H3>
<P>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for =
software and=20
other kinds of works.</P>
<P>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed =
to take=20
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU =
General=20
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change =
all=20
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its =
users.=20
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for =
most of=20
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its =

authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not =
price. Our=20
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the =
freedom to=20
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), =
that you=20
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change =
the=20
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you =
can do=20
these things.</P>
<P>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you =
these=20
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have =
certain=20
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you =
modify it:=20
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</P>
<P>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether =
gratis or=20
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you =

received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the =
source code.=20
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</P>
<P>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: =
(1)=20
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving =
you=20
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</P>
<P>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains =
that=20
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and =
authors' sake,=20
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that =
their=20
problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous =
versions.</P>
<P>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run =
modified=20
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do =
so. This=20
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom =
to=20
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the =
area of=20
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most=20
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to =
prohibit=20
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in =
other=20
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in =
future=20
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</P>
<P>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. =
States=20
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on=20
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the =
special=20
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively=20
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be =
used to=20
render the program non-free.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and =
modification=20
follow.</P>
<H3><A name=3Dterms></A>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H3>
<H4><A name=3Dsection0></A>0. Definitions.</H4>
<P>=E2=80=9CThis License=E2=80=9D refers to version 3 of the GNU General =
Public License.</P>
<P>=E2=80=9CCopyright=E2=80=9D also means copyright-like laws that apply =
to other kinds of=20
works, such as semiconductor masks.</P>
<P>=E2=80=9CThe Program=E2=80=9D refers to any copyrightable work =
licensed under this License.=20
Each licensee is addressed as =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D. =
=E2=80=9CLicensees=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Crecipients=E2=80=9D may be=20
individuals or organizations.</P>
<P>To =E2=80=9Cmodify=E2=80=9D a work means to copy from or adapt all or =
part of the work in a=20
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an =
exact copy.=20
The resulting work is called a =E2=80=9Cmodified version=E2=80=9D of the =
earlier work or a work=20
=E2=80=9Cbased on=E2=80=9D the earlier work.</P>
<P>A =E2=80=9Ccovered work=E2=80=9D means either the unmodified Program =
or a work based on the=20
Program.</P>
<P>To =E2=80=9Cpropagate=E2=80=9D a work means to do anything with it =
that, without permission,=20
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under =
applicable=20
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private =
copy.=20
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without =
modification),=20
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities =
as=20
well.</P>
<P>To =E2=80=9Cconvey=E2=80=9D a work means any kind of propagation that =
enables other parties=20
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a =
computer=20
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</P>
<P>An interactive user interface displays =E2=80=9CAppropriate Legal =
Notices=E2=80=9D to the=20
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature =
that (1)=20
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that =
there is=20
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are =
provided),=20
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a =
copy of=20
this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or =
options, such=20
as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection1></A>1. Source Code.</H4>
<P>The =E2=80=9Csource code=E2=80=9D for a work means the preferred form =
of the work for making=20
modifications to it. =E2=80=9CObject code=E2=80=9D means any non-source =
form of a work.</P>
<P>A =E2=80=9CStandard Interface=E2=80=9D means an interface that either =
is an official standard=20
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces =
specified=20
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among =
developers=20
working in that language.</P>
<P>The =E2=80=9CSystem Libraries=E2=80=9D of an executable work include =
anything, other than the=20
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a =
Major=20
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves =
only to=20
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a =
Standard=20
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in =
source code=20
form. A =E2=80=9CMajor Component=E2=80=9D, in this context, means a =
major essential component=20
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if =
any) on=20
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, =
or an=20
object code interpreter used to run it.</P>
<P>The =E2=80=9CCorresponding Source=E2=80=9D for a work in object code =
form means all the=20
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) =
run the=20
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those=20
activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or =

general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are =
used=20
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the =
work.=20
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files =
associated=20
with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries =
and=20
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to =

require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between =
those=20
subprograms and other parts of the work.</P>
<P>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can =
regenerate=20
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</P>
<P>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same=20
work.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection2></A>2. Basic Permissions.</H4>
<P>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of =
copyright=20
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are =
met. This=20
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the =
unmodified=20
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this =
License only=20
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This =
License=20
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by =

copyright law.</P>
<P>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, =
without=20
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may =
convey=20
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make =
modifications=20
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those =
works,=20
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all =

material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or =
running=20
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under =
your=20
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any =
copies of=20
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</P>
<P>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the =

conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes =
it=20
unnecessary.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection3></A>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From=20
Anti-Circumvention Law.</H4>
<P>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological =
measure=20
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the =
WIPO=20
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws =
prohibiting or=20
restricting circumvention of such measures.</P>
<P>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid=20
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention =
is=20
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the =
covered=20
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification =
of the=20
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third =
parties'=20
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection4></A>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</H4>
<P>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you =
receive=20
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately =
publish on=20
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices =
stating that=20
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 =
apply=20
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and =
give=20
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</P>
<P>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, =
and you=20
may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection5></A>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</H4>
<P>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to =
produce=20
it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of =
section 4,=20
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified =
it, and=20
  giving a relevant date.=20
  <LI>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is =
released under=20
  this License and any conditions added under section 7. This =
requirement=20
  modifies the requirement in section 4 to =E2=80=9Ckeep intact all =
notices=E2=80=9D.=20
  <LI>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this =
License to=20
  anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will =
therefore apply,=20
  along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of =
the=20
  work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This =
License=20
  gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does =
not=20
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.=20
  <LI>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display=20
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive =
interfaces=20
  that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make =
them do=20
  so. </LI></UL>
<P>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent =
works,=20
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which =
are not=20
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of =
a=20
storage or distribution medium, is called an =E2=80=9Caggregate=E2=80=9D =
if the compilation and=20
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights =
of the=20
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion =
of a=20
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the =
other=20
parts of the aggregate.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection6></A>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</H4>
<P>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of =
sections=20
4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable =
Corresponding Source=20
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product=20
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the =
Corresponding=20
  Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for =
software=20
  interchange.=20
  <LI>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product=20
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written =
offer,=20
  valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer =
spare parts=20
  or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who =
possesses the=20
  object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the =
software=20
  in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical =
medium=20
  customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than =
your=20
  reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or =
(2)=20
  access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no =
charge.=20
  <LI>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the =
written=20
  offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed =
only=20
  occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object =
code=20
  with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.=20
  <LI>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated =
place=20
  (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the =
Corresponding=20
  Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. =
You need=20
  not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the =
object=20
  code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the=20
  Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or =
a third=20
  party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you =
maintain=20
  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the=20
  Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the =
Corresponding=20
  Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as =
long as=20
  needed to satisfy these requirements.=20
  <LI>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, =
provided you=20
  inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of =
the work=20
  are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection =
6d.=20
</LI></UL>
<P>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded =
from=20
the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in =
conveying=20
the object code work.</P>
<P>A =E2=80=9CUser Product=E2=80=9D is either (1) a =E2=80=9Cconsumer =
product=E2=80=9D, which means any tangible=20
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or =
household=20
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a =
dwelling. In=20
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases =
shall be=20
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a =
particular=20
user, =E2=80=9Cnormally used=E2=80=9D refers to a typical or common use =
of that class of=20
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way =
in which=20
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the =

product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the =
product has=20
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such =
uses=20
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</P>
<P>=E2=80=9CInstallation Information=E2=80=9D for a User Product means =
any methods, procedures,=20
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute =

modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified =
version=20
of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that =
the=20
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case =
prevented or=20
interfered with solely because modification has been made.</P>
<P>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or=20
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as =
part of a=20
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product =
is=20
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term =
(regardless of=20
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed =
under=20
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But =
this=20
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains =
the=20
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for =
example, the=20
work has been installed in ROM).</P>
<P>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include =
a=20
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates =
for a=20
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the =
User=20
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network =
may be=20
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the =

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for =
communication=20
across the network.</P>
<P>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, =
in=20
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented =
(and=20
with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and =
must=20
require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or =
copying.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection7></A>7. Additional Terms.</H4>
<P>=E2=80=9CAdditional permissions=E2=80=9D are terms that supplement =
the terms of this License=20
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional =
permissions=20
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though =
they were=20
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under =
applicable=20
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that =
part may=20
be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program =
remains=20
governed by this License without regard to the additional =
permissions.</P>
<P>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option =
remove any=20
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. =
(Additional=20
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases =
when=20
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, =
added by=20
you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate =
copyright=20
permission.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you =
add to=20
a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that=20
material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the =
terms=20
  of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or=20
  <LI>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or =
author=20
  attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices =
displayed by=20
  works containing it; or=20
  <LI>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, =
or=20
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in =
reasonable ways=20
  as different from the original version; or=20
  <LI>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors =
or=20
  authors of the material; or=20
  <LI>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some =
trade=20
  names, trademarks, or service marks; or=20
  <LI>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that =
material by=20
  anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with =
contractual=20
  assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that =
these=20
  contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and =
authors.=20
</LI></UL>
<P>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered =
=E2=80=9Cfurther=20
restrictions=E2=80=9D within the meaning of section 10. If the Program =
as you received=20
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by =
this=20
License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove =
that=20
term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits=20
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered =
work=20
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that =
the=20
further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</P>
<P>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you =
must=20
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms =
that=20
apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the =
applicable=20
terms.</P>
<P>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the =
form of=20
a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above =
requirements=20
apply either way.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection8></A>8. Termination.</H4>
<P>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly =
provided=20
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is =
void, and=20
will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including =
any=20
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</P>
<P>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your =
license from a=20
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and =
until=20
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and =
(b)=20
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the =
violation by=20
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</P>
<P>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is =
reinstated=20
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by =
some=20
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of =
violation=20
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure =
the=20
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</P>
<P>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the =
licenses=20
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this =
License. If=20
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do =
not=20
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section =
10.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection9></A>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having =
Copies.</H4>
<P>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or =
run a copy=20
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely =
as a=20
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy =
likewise does=20
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants =
you=20
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions =
infringe=20
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or=20
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License =
to do=20
so.</P>
<H4><A name=3Dsection10></A>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream =
Recipients.</H4>
<P>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically =
receives a=20
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that =
work,=20
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing =
compliance by=20
third parties with this License.</P>
<P>An =E2=80=9Centity transaction=E2=80=9D is a transaction transferring =
control of an=20
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an=20
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work =
results=20
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives =
a copy=20
of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's =
predecessor=20
in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right =
to=20
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor =
in=20
